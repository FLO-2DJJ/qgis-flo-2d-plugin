changelog=
 <p>0.10.2
  - Report Levee crest lower than cell elevations. Create points layer for those levee cells.
  - Remove 'Import' button from Table Editor dialog.
  - Change layer name: 'Hydraulic Structures Table' to 'Hydraulic Structures'
  - Fix 'MANNINGS_N_DAT is missing' when loading project.
  - 'No Failure' option when creating User Levees from walls shapefile.
 <p>0.10.1
  - Delete levee directions duplicates
 <p>0.10.0
  - Individual levee direction failure calculated using adjacent cell elevation.
 <p>0.9.9
  - Elevation sampling, removing sampling using raster overview. 
  - Mannings roughness defaults.
  - DEBUG: check null values. 
  - Storm Drain Time series null values.
 <p>0.9.8
  - Levees from walls shapefile: when Depth is selected from walls shapefile, highest adjacent cell elevation added to fail elevation.
  - ARF-WRF: export of ARF.DAT fix when no User Blocked Areas exist.
 <p>0.9.7
 - Plots: delete previous legend from previous plot
 - Levees from walls: select elevation or depth fields from walls shapefile.
 - Storm Drain dialog for external inflows, patterns, and time series.
 - Warnings and Errors tool: create DEBUG and current issues points layer.
 - Sampling Manning's values from polygon shapefile: intercept grid with areas and assign average.
 <p>0.9.6
 - Grid creation: corrects shifting of grid from computational domain. 
 <p>0.9.5
 - Storm Drain: external inflows data read/writen to .INP files. Operations included to define external inflows to storm drain nodes. 
 <p>0.9.4
 - DEBUG errors: points layer "DEBUG" created. 
   DEBUG errors dialog: dropdown list of error numbers enabled with ascending error numbers.
 <p>0.9.3
 - Manning-n values: grid intersection with shapefile polygons:
   values averaged according to areas of intersection.
 <p>0.9.2
 - Hydraulic structures include bridges
 <p>0.9.1
 - Individual levees dialog highlights failure directions with colors.
   Changes to failure data saved for all modified directions for selected cell.
   Buttons to load 1000 elements at a time, back and forward.
 - Errors and warnings dialogs simplified. Faster loading of grid numbers dropdown list.
 - IARFBLOCKMOD variable included in Control Parameters dialog
 <p>0.9.0
 - Creates Levees from walls shapefile. New dialog to select levee (walls) failure fields from shapefile. Individual Levees dialog includes adjacent cells elevations and zoom in and out to selected levee cell
 <p>0.8.9
