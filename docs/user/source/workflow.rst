Working With the Plugin
=======================

In the example below, it is assumed that user is generating a hydraulic model from scratch. First step to build a model, is to create fresh database, where all the model files will reside.

Database Connection
-------------------
Either create new GeoPackage or connect to existing one.

Import GDS ASCII Files (Optional)
---------------------------------

Users can import model data created in GDS.

Create or Modify Model Data
---------------------------

Create new model from scratch using plugin tools and/or modify existing model data.
Various tools help to view/inspect model data.

Export GDS ASCII Files
----------------------

Once the model data is defined, users can export it to ASCII files read by the solver or GDS.
