## HYSTRUC.DAT 

HYSTRUC.DAT information goes into the following GeoPackage tables:

* struct - general info about each structure, STRUCHAR=S
* rat_curves - rating curves data, STRUCHAR=C
* repl_rat_curves - replacement rating curves data, STRUCHAR=R
* rat_table - rating tables data, STRUCHAR=T
* culvert_equations - culvert equations data, STRUCHAR=F
* storm_drains - storm drains data, STRUCHAR=D

as a power function of the headwater depth
